Postman Collection using the TomTom Maps APIs

Please use your own API KEY and ADMIN KEY from https://developer.tomtom.com

From our TomTom Devisodes (https://www.youtube.com/c/tomtomdevelopers ) we did some Asset tracking and these are the Rest APIs we used to create fences, alerts, objects and more!
